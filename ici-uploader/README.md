If building this app locally, you need to create the following in this directory:

```
resources/src/illumina-api-key.txt
resources/src/ici-uploader-bundle_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

These must be placed in this directory before `dx build_asset ici-uploader` is run.
The API key file and `ici-uploader` package are available on the ICI platform - log in and consult the manual for details.
